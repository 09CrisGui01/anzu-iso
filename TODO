* Fix generation scripts... which pretty much suck right now...

* Add lots and lots of help to the grub menus... also add the 
  graphics to all submenus

* possible auto-detection of installed systems via nifty grub tricks?

* generalize adding more images/plain dirs/overlays to the disk

* push to projects.archlinux.org

* win.

* (Dan) We should have the ability to add packages in two ways- package lists
  that pull from the sync DBs (-S), and packages files as well (-U).

* (Dan) Pacman DBs should not have to be synced multiple times (one for each
  package list + kernel). They should be synced the first time and that should
  cover our bases. This may be a pacman bug.

* pregenerate some locales inside the image so we don't constantly get errors
  about not having them
