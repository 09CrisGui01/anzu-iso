* Split boot hook - one hook to export SQUASHFS_IMAGE location
  second hook uses this too boot.  Add hooks for finding image
  on different media.

* Fix generation scripts... which pretty much suck right now...

* Add lots and lots of help to the grub menus... also add the 
  graphics to all submenus

* possible auto-detection of installed systems via nifty grub tricks?
