* Installer CD should *NOT* set a timezone in rc.conf, because on shutdown,
  it may undo settings made in the installer (rc.shutdown does nothing special
  if TIMEZONE is blank)

* We're doing way to much at the Makefile level (see the ISO Makefile). I don't
  like this, but I have no ideas as to a clean way to implement these things in
  the archiso script itself without getting too specific. Ideas would be helpful

* Fix xfce and defaul config directories.

* Make the default config more bare - less grub fancieness

* Complete isolinux support

* Fix grub / grub-gfx detection and copying

* Add lots and lots of help to the grub menus... also add the 
  graphics to all submenus

* possible auto-detection of installed systems via nifty grub tricks?

* (Dan) We should have the ability to add packages in two ways- package lists
  that pull from the sync DBs (-S), and packages files as well (-U).
