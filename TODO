* Fix xfce and default config directories.

* Add lots and lots of help to the grub menus... also add the 
  graphics to all submenus

* possible auto-detection of installed systems via nifty grub tricks?

* Switch to squashfs-lzma

* Switch to aufs (less important that lzma)

* Add 'needsupdate' function to check if a squashfs image in the
  iso dir is up to date, if so, skip it; else rebuild it. No more
  need for the -f flag

* Remove the need for the -f flag overall. We should be able to do
  all this intelligently

* Make the bootloader flag work with usb images too
